               <h2>The main points that a draftsman can do are:-</h2>
               <ol>
                <li> Drafting drawings based on an architect's design that will be used to construct buildings</li>
                <br>
                <li>Using rough sketches, drawings and notes to create a design</li>
                <br>
                <li>Preparing maps, wiring layouts, product design or machinery layouts</li>
                <br>
                <li>Using different types of software to create a single design</li>
                <br>
                <li> Revising and adjusting designs as needed during construction or product creation</li>
               </ol>
               <p>There are a wide variety of CAD drafter specialties, 
                including architectural, engineering, electrical and 
                civil drafting. Each of these requires a different set 
                of skills and many of them require different software.</p>
                <h1 id="top">What are important to learn in order to became a CAD DRAFTER?</h1>
               
                <p>It is essential to learn the specific software for the type of 
                    drafting you will be doing. Organizations may be more willing
                     to teach the engineering aspect of the job, but you are 
                     expected to be an expert in the software you will be using.</p>
                     <p>There are different CAD drafter fields such as 
                        <b> civil drafters, architectural drafters, and 
                         electrical drafters</b>. While the work is similar,
                          there are quite a few differences between CAD 
                          drafter fields. Civil drafters will likely be 
                          designing geographical maps, architectural drafters
                           will be creating drawings of structural features
                            and building designs, and electrical drafters 
                            create layout drawings and wiring diagrams. 
                            Other types of drafting designs might include 
                            creating the wiring layout for electronics or 
                            drawing a product design for manufacturers.</p>

               <h4>Detail design</h4>
                <p>A draftsman prepares technical drawings either 
                    manually or using computer-aided drafting. 
                    While CAD utilizes computer programs, manual 
                    drafting uses a myriad of tools that haven't 
                    changed much over the years. These include the 
                    T-Square, various straight edges, triangles, 
                    curves and erasing shields to keep projects clean.
                     Many of the tools you've likely been introduced 
                     to in high school geometry, such as the compass 
                     and the protractor.</p>

               <h4>Cost estimsting of project</h4>
               <p>Direct vs. Indirect Costs</p>
               <p>There are many factors that go into a construction
                    project's cost estimate. They typically fall 
                    into one of two main categories: direct and indirect
                     costs. Direct costs may include things like materials
                      and labor, including wages for different parts of
                       the team, equipment fuel and resources needed to 
                       get the job done.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 28px;font-family:Georgia ;"><b>T-squares</b> are used to draw <i>straight lines</i>. 
            The <em>head of the square</em>, the cross member, 
            is placed along the left edge or the top of 
            the drafting table, while the square's blade 
            is laid across the table's top, over the drawing 
            paper. The <ins>drafter</ins> slides the square up, down or 
            across on the tabletop, as required by a design, 
            always keeping the flat side of the square flush
             with the tabletop's edge. <strong>This action keeps the
              square's blade parallel to the tabletop's </strong>
              edges. The drafter draws a horizontal line by 
              resting the pencil's tip atop the square's blade, 
              then pulling the pen right while maintaining a slight
               pressure against the blade.</p>

            <h1>How to become a CAD Drafter</h1>
                <p>CAD drafters are required to complete a two-year 
                associate's degree after high school, usually at a 
                community college or technical school. It is helpful 
                to extend the education to a bachelor's degree but it's 
                not necessary to get a job in the field. CAD drafters 
                may also acquire an American Design Drafting Association 
                (ADDA) certification to further legitimize their education</p>
